 Getting each dishview to link to their respective editview page was challenging.
 When creating the dish model and adding it to the collection, the id would only
 be created after being saved to the local storage. Furthermore we found that the
 dish had to be saved after adding it to the collection otherwise it would complain
 about the storage. Since the dishesview added dishviews to its template by 
 listening for add events on the collection, the listener would fire before the
 dish model id would be available and the dishview template would not be able to
 fill in the href attribute without the dish models unique id. We solved this by 
 adding a custom event after saving the model to the collection. Instead of listening
 for an add event to render the dishview, we could listen to the custom event when
 the id is available.
